Doesnâ€™t it sound fun to command the keyboard using our eyes?
We can achieve that with building a Gaze Controlled Virtual Keyboard.
The virtual gaze controlled keyboard will enable people suffering from disabilities to type using their eyes instead of their hands.
The virtual keyboard consists of:English letters, Delete Key, Backspace key, Numerical digits
