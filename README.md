The application is built using MEAN stack and has 3 microservices. These microservices are: Admin, Washer and Customer

# MEAN Stack
The MEAN stack is JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications. MEAN is named after MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node, the four key technologies that make up the layers of the stack.

MongoDB - document database
Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
Angular(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

MEAN applications can be used in many ways with a cross platform write once approach. While MEAN is particularly suited to real-time applications, particularly those running natively in the cloud and single-page (dynamic) web applications built in Angular.js, it can be used for other use cases such as:

Workflow management tools.
News aggregation sites.
Todo and calendar applications.
Interactive forums.
And much more.

Since all the components are based on JavaScript and JSON, the integration between the components of the stack is intuitive and straightforward.

Additionally, the E and A of MEAN (Express and Angular) are two of the most popular and well-supported JavaScript frameworks for back-end and front-end development, respectively. Express makes routing and managing HTTP requests and responses super easy, and includes great support for middleware to handle JSON endpoints and form posts. Angular is a powerful tool for building dynamic HTML pages that communicate with a back-end server.

Whether you’re building a high-throughput API, a simple web application, or a microservice, MEAN is the ideal stack for building Node.js applications.

All of the MEAN stack components are open source in nature and therefore allow a generous, free-of-charge opportunity for developers.
